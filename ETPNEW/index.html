                        <h2>Course Fee Structure</h2>
                        <p>
                            Lovely Professional University (LPU) is one of the largest universities in India, with over
                            30,000 students and 2,000 faculty members. The university offers over 200 programs in
                            multiple disciplines, including engineering, business, law, architecture, and management.
                            The fee structure for LPU varies depending on the course and specialization. For example,
                            the B.Tech program has a fee range of INR 4.2 lakh to INR 15.2 lakh, while MBA costs fall
                            between INR 7.60 lakh and INR 9.60 lakh.
                            LPU also offers scholarships to students who score well in the LPUNEST exam. For example,
                            students who score 95% marks or above in LPUNEST 2024 are eligible for a 50% scholarship.
                            In addition to tuition fees, students also need to pay for hostel fees and other
                            miscellaneous expenses. The hostel fees at LPU are INR 3,000 per month, which includes
                            breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Other miscellaneous expenses, such as books and stationery,
                            can vary depending on the student's needs.
                            Overall, the fee structure at LPU is comparable to other private universities in India.
                            However, LPU offers a wide range of scholarships and financial aid options to help students
                            afford their education.
